-- Tips:- Don't overcrowd the broccoli on the baking sheet for best crisping- Both dishes cook at the same temperature (425°F), making timing easy- The broccoli's crispy edges will be ready right when the chicken finishes- Use a meat thermometer to ensure chicken reaches 165°F internal temperature- Can substitute chicken broth for some of the butter for lighter version
