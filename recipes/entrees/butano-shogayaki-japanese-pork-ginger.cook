@{For the sauce:}1. Season the thinly sliced @thinly pork{1%lb} with a pinch of salt on both sides.

@{For the sauce:}2. Lightly coat the @thinly pork{1%lb} slices with @-3 tablespoons wheat flour{2}. This helps keep the meat juicy and allows it to absorb the @soy sauce{3%tbsp} better.

@{For the sauce:}3. In a small bowl, mix together @soy sauce{3%tbsp}, @mirin{2%tbsp}, and @sugar{1%tbsp} (if using) to create the sauce. Set aside.

@{For the sauce:}4. Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat.

@{For the sauce:}5. Add the @-3 tablespoons wheat flour{2}-coated @thinly pork{1%lb} slices to the pan. Cook for 2-3 minutes per side until golden brown and cooked through.

@{For the sauce:}6. Add the grated or julienned @-3 inches ginger{2} to the pan and stir-fry for about 30 seconds until fragrant.

@{For the sauce:}7. Pour the @soy sauce{3%tbsp} mixture over the @thinly pork{1%lb} and @-3 inches ginger{2}. Toss everything together, allowing the sauce to coat the meat and create a glaze. Cook for another 1-2 minutes.

@{For the sauce:}8. Serve immediately over steamed white rice with thinly sliced raw @-3 cups cabbage{2} on the side.

@{For the sauce:}Note: The key to this dish is using very thinly sliced @thinly pork{1%lb}, which allows it to cook quickly and absorb the flavors well - perfect for eating with chopsticks!

-- - Look for pre-sliced pork at Asian grocery stores, or ask your butcher to slice pork shoulder or loin very thinly- The flour coating is traditional and helps create the perfect texture- Adjust sweetness by adding more or less sugar/mirin to taste- Fresh ginger is essential - don't substitute with powder
