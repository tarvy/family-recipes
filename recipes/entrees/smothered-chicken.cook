1. Season the chicken generously with @Salt, @Black pepper{}, @@garlic{4%cloves} powder{}, and @Paprika.

2. Heat @oil{2%tbsp} in a skillet or dutch oven over medium-high heat. Sear the chicken until golden-brown on both sides, about 4-5 minutes per side. Remove and set aside (it won't be cooked through yet).

3. In the same pan with the fond, add the sliced @Green onions{} and @bell peppers{2}. Season with @Salt and cook until softened and starting to caramelize, about 8-10 minutes. Add the minced @garlic{4%cloves} near the end and cook for another minute.

4. Sprinkle the @flour{2-3%tbsp} over the vegetables and stir for about 1 minute to cook out the raw flour taste.

5. Slowly pour in the @chicken broth{2%cups}, stirring constantly and scraping up all the browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Stir until the gravy thickens.

6. Nestle the chicken back into the gravy, spooning some gravy over the top. Cover with a lid and reduce heat to low.

7. Simmer for 25-30 minutes until the chicken is cooked through and tender.

8. Scatter @Green onions{} on top before serving. Serve over rice with green beans on the side.

-- Bone-in, skin-on thighs work best for flavor and staying juicy, but boneless breasts work too—just reduce the simmering time to avoid drying them out. The gravy is the star here, so don't skip scraping up all those browned bits from the pan.
