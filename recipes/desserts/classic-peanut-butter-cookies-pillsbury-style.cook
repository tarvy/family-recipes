@{Dry Ingredients:}1. Preheat oven to 375°F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper or leave ungreased.

@{Dry Ingredients:}2. Whisk together @all-purpose flour{1.25%cups}, @baking soda{0.5%tsp}, @baking powder{0.5%tsp}, and @salt{0.25%tsp} in a medium bowl. Set aside.

@{Dry Ingredients:}3. In a large bowl, beat @1 stick unsalted butter{0.5%cup}, @creamy peanut butter{1%cup}, @@granulated sugar{0.25%cup}{0.5%cup}, and @packed brown sugar{0.5%cup} with mixer until light and fluffy (2-3 minutes).

@{Dry Ingredients:}4. Beat in @egg{1%large} and @vanilla extract{1%tsp} until well combined.

@{Dry Ingredients:}5. Gradually mix dry ingredients into wet ingredients until just combined. Don't overmix.

@{Dry Ingredients:}6. Roll dough into 1-inch balls. Roll each ball in @@granulated @packed brown sugar{0.5%cup}{0.25%cup}{0.5%cup} to coat.

@{Dry Ingredients:}7. Place balls 2 inches apart on baking sheets. Use a fork to press a crosshatch pattern into each cookie (press once, rotate 90°, press again). Dip fork in @granulated @packed brown @granulated sugar{0.25%cup}{0.5%cup}{0.5%cup} between cookies to prevent sticking.

@{Dry Ingredients:}8. Bake 10-12 minutes until edges are set but centers still look slightly soft and underdone.

@{Dry Ingredients:}9. Let cookies cool on baking sheet for 2-3 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

-- TIPS:- The secret: Pull them when they look slightly underbaked - they'll firm up as they cool but stay soft and chewy inside- Room temperature: Make sure butter is truly softened for best texture- Peanut butter: Stick with standard creamy peanut butter (not natural/separated style)- Storage: Keep in an airtight container for up to 5 days
