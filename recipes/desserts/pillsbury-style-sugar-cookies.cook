1. Preheat oven to 375°F.

2. In a bowl, mix together the @all-purpose flour{2.75%cups}, @baking soda{1%tsp}, @baking powder{0.5%tsp}, and @salt{0.5%tsp}. Set aside.

3. In a large bowl, cream together the softened @2 sticks butter{1%cup} and @white sugar{1.5%cups} until fluffy, about 3-4 minutes.

4. Beat in the @egg{1}, @vanilla extract{1%tsp}, and @almond extract{0.25%tsp} until well combined.

5. Gradually blend in the dry ingredients until you have a soft dough. If the dough is too sticky, chill it for 30 minutes.

6. Roll dough into balls (about 1½ tablespoons each) and place them 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets.

7. Optional: Flatten slightly with the bottom of a glass dipped in @white sugar{1.5%cups}.

8. Bake for 8-10 minutes. They should look slightly underdone when you pull them out - edges will be set but centers still soft.

9. Let cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack.

-- - Don't overbake - pull them when they're still pale for perfect chewy texture- Use room temperature butter, not melted- The almond extract is key for that Pillsbury flavor- Optional: Chill dough balls for 10-15 minutes before baking to prevent spreading- DO NOT add cream of tartar - it makes them crispier- Make sure to use the full 2¾ cups flour or they'll spread too thin
