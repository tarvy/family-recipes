# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Read AGENTS.md

You MUST read `AGENTS.md` before taking any action in this repository.

This is not optional. This is not a suggestion. This is a hard requirement.

Do not:
- Write code
- Create files
- Modify files
- Plan implementation
- Reason about "small changes" that might not need process

Until you have read `AGENTS.md` in full.

The instructions in `AGENTS.md` govern all AI agent behavior in this codebase. Failure to follow them is a failure to do the job correctly.

Read it now.
